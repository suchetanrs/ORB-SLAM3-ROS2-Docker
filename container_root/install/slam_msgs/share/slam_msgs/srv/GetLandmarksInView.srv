# this is the max angle between the given pose

# the landmark was observed. (in rad)
# max(Δyaw, Δroll, Δpitch) is considered as the angle of interest.
# setting it to > pi will disregard the angle of observation.

# this is the max distance between the given pose
# and the previous keyframe pose from which
# the landmark was observed. (in m)
# if you wish to get landmarks until atleast x m from the pose, this value must be x.
